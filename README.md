# Page Transitions in Gatsby

Experiments with page transitions in Gatsby.

- Mount page transitions: `checkout master`
- Mount full-page transition: `checkout full-page`
- Mount/Unmount transitions with react-spring: `checkout react-spring-transition`

## TODO

- Remove the order field
- Add an extra slash in the end if the pathname doesn't have one.
